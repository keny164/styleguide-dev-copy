# Apollo Overview

Apollo 1.0 which puts the data that's been gathered through Janus into context, so you can manage it efficiently and house the responsibility of data semantics within DigitalVault. Apollo simplifies object relationship management by offering a single API layer for time series and events in rest and in motion. It also offers an API layer to access multi-modal data, eliminating the need to maintain many indexes among entities, time series and more. As an example, this service could be used to enable an application to easily retrieve data to analyze efficiency and predict cost savings. Apollo can also be used to create a virtual version of a physical structure, such as a floor or room, making it easy conceptualize the relationships between building assets. 

*Apollo API endpoints are only available in UAT.
