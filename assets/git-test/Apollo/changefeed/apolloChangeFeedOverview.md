# Change Feed Overview

Change feed provides the ability to keep track of changes to entities and relationships within an ER collection. You can see the change feed messages by either going through the Change Feed API (<xref:getChangeFeedNotifications.md>) or subscribing to the messages (<xref:subscribeChangeFeed.md>).
